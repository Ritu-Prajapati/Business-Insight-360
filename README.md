⛳Project Objective: 
I created a project based on AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing consumer electronics company struggling with Excel-based analytics. Their reliance on outdated tools led to significant losses in Latin America due to ineffective insights. 
👉The goal was create a report which focuses on improving their data analytics to drive better business decisions.

🔎 Power BI Dashboard Overview:
The dashboard comprises six pages-->

**Finance View**:  
Analyzes profit and loss (LY vs Target) and net sales performance over time. Highlights top products and customers by net sales.

**Sales View**:  
Tracks customer performance across platforms and product performance. Includes net sales breakdown, GM%, and regional metrics.

**Marketing View**:  
Focuses on product, region, and customer performance. Also covers net profit by evaluating gross margin and operating expenses.

**Supply Chain View**:  
Monitors forecast accuracy, net/absolute error, and key metrics by customer. Shows net error trends and product metrics.

**Executive View**:  
Provides market share comparison (AtliQ vs competitors) and year-over-year trends. Includes revenue analysis by channel and region.
